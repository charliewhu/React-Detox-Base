# React Native E2E Testing with Detox

A blank canvas React Native project for running end-to-end tests on Android with Detox. This was forked from [Dane Grant's repo here](https://github.com/danecando/JSM-Detox).


## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charliewhu/React-Detox-Base.git
cd React-Detox-Base
yarn
```

## Running

### Android

Run this command (and keep it running):

```bash
yarn start
```

Then, in a new terminal window:

```bash
yarn build
yarn detox
```
These are custom commands which will build a debug .apk and then run detox test on the build.

## Add to your own new repo

```
git remote rm origin 
git remote add origin <your github repo.git>
git push origin master
```
